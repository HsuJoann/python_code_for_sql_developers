# Python_code_for_sql_experts
This repository contains 6 Python code files that I used in: 
https://appdev.pass.org/Meeting-Details/EventID/15791

high level for python learning (google with the accurate key words):
sql server    concatinate several strings with some null values
python list
python dictionary
pandas dataframe
pyspark dataframe
pyspark rdd


pandas dataframe:
1. import one excel file to SQL server (connection string, packages, data frame, DATAFRAME)
2. import several excel files into one sql server (loop, string formating)
dictionary: 
3. import several several sheets of one excel file into one sql server (loop, string formating, dictionary)
list/tuple:
4. fast exec
5. from a query out (parameter, string formatring, change to dataframe)
 

Future landscape for SQL expert with Python:
